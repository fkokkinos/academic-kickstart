I am currently a Ph.D. student at UCL under the supervision of Prof. [Iasonas Kokkinos](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/I.Kokkinos/). Before that, I was a member of the Computational Imaging Group (CIG) at Skoltech, where I collaborated with Prof. [Stamatis Lefkimmiatis](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=3Bawtm4AAAAJ) on learnable regularizers. My research interests include machine learning, computational photography, computer vision, and inverse imaging problems. I completed my diploma studies in Greece at the National Technical University of Athens, where I worked closely with Prof. [Alexandros Potamianos](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en/staff/188).

At the moment, I am working on the development of unsupervised 3D deep networks. Building models that can project pixels accurately to geometric models and back is the essence of high-level scene understanding.  In the past, I have worked on the development of novel computational photography algorithms and human emotion recognition from conversational speech data.

In addition to doing research, I love dancing, working out, and traveling.

For more information about me, see my [CV](files/cv.pdf) or [contact me](mailto:filippos.kokkinos.19@ucl.ac.uk).
